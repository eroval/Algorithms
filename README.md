## Some of it is from homework through courses in uni, others are just because. Most are some "casual" implementations and not meant to be used as structures or algorithms in full-fledged programs. They were done purely for the exercise and need to be reworked if used for real projects.

# To do:
- AVL Tree
- Red-black Tree
- Iterative versions of different algos and structures

# Sorting Algorithms
- Selection Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Quick Sort
- Merge Sort

#Data Structures
- Balanced Trees
- Binary Search Tree
- Binary Search Tree with node removal
- Queue
- Stack
## //Note:
    All have multiple implementations.

# Linear Algebra
- Matrix Multiplication
- Equation Solver and Variables Finder (based on upper Triangulation)
